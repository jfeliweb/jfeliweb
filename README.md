# 👋 Hey, I’m Jean (aka **@jfeliweb**)

🚀 **Senior Software Engineer | Builder of Internet Things | AI Tinkerer | Occasional Bug Whisperer**

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where enterprise-grade code meets curiosity, caffeine, and just enough humor to keep things human.

## 🧠 Who Am I (and Why Are You Here?)
